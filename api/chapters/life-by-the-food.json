To explore the path that brought him to the table, because food isn’t born on the plate but when it gets there it brings along the history that gives it its flavor. The Mesaluisa is a secret corner of a cosmopolitan city where the real tasting stories live. Where the palates of our grandmother’s kitchen are the sincere motto that awakens a moment that won’t repeat itself but can be eternal, and where the stories gain a new life and become more and more present.</p>"
